Well done!

2.a
Null doesn't work correctly with IN. Because it 's the same as "=NULL".

2.b
Name conditions should be divided by ( ), because at least one of them should definetily be correct.

2.c
You had the scheme for this task, please use it.
Your solution will return correct results. But what if we want to see names? I'm not sure that we have Vendor name in ProductVendor.

3.b
It's not one list. We want to see one column with all names+stores.

It would be great to rewrite the solution for 2c. :)
